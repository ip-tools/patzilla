PatZilla: Patent information research for humans
################################################

About
=====
PatZilla is a modular patent information research platform and
data integration toolkit. It features an efficient user interface
and access to multiple data sources.

The system provides convenient access to the OPS service from EPO and
other professional fulltext patent databases in its standalone version.
You can also use its software components and interfaces for
building arbitrary vendor solutions.

Features
========

- Multiple data source APIs.

  - Use different patent search services with varying coverage.
  - Connect to multiple services for pdf-, image-, bibliographic data and fulltext acquisition.

- User interface. Based on contemporary web technologies and responsive design, it works on multiple devices.
  Use it on PCs, tablets, smartphone devices or as a multi-screen solution. The clear and well-arranged
  design and layout permits efficient screening of large numbers of patent documents.

- Dossier management. Manage different collections of patent documents and apply ratings and comments.

- REST API. Through the extensive REST API, all functionality is available to 3rd-party systems.
  Deep integration has no limits.

- Sharing. Well-designed collaboration features allow efficient sharing of information with your
  colleagues and partners, even across the boundaries of in-house systems.

- Multitenancy. The software can operate on behalf of different vendors. It's easy to apply custom branding.

Demos
=====
- The `search demo`_ will run the fixed query::

      txt=(SS7 or (telecommunication or communication or comunicación) or (mobile or Mobilfunknetz) or (network or (security or Sicherung))) and
      pa=(mobil or kommunikation) and
      cl=(H04W12/12 or H04L63/0281 or H04L63/0414)
      not pn=(CN or CA or JP)

  ... against EPO/OPS and display the results.
  You will be able to step through result pages and display fulltext- and family-information,
  but running custom queries will be disabled.

- The `numberlist demo`_ will display the patent documents DE102011075997A1, DE102011076020A1, DE102011076022A1 and DE102011076035A1.
  This is a showcase about how to integrate a link to a list of patent documents into own applications.

- The `document view demo`_ will display the patent document EP0666666A2 without any control elements.
  This is a showcase about how to embed the document view into own applications or
  how to directly link to single documents.

- The `nasa-public-domain demo`_ displays the latest `NASA patents put under the public domain <NASA public domain_>`_.

History
=======
The software got some applause from professional researchers for its unique user
interface and rich feature set when it was released to the first audience in 2014.
We hear from our users they are still having a great pleasure working with it on
a daily basis.

After four years of development, the source code finally gets released under an
open source license in 2017. We are looking forward to opening up the development
process as well, every kind of participation and support is very much welcome.

After a project hiatus from 2020 to 2022, the code base is getting a refresh,
many software tests have been added, and the aim is to finish migration to
Python 3 within the end of the year.
