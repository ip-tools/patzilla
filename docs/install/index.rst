Installation
############

This part of the documentation covers the installation of PatZilla.
The first step to using any software package is getting it properly installed.
Please read this section carefully.

After successfully installing the software, you might want to
follow up with its :ref:`configuration`.

Installation of PatZilla can be done natively on your system, or by using
Docker. Depending on your preferences, please follow either
:ref:`install-linux-macos` or :ref:`install-docker`.

If you are interested in contributing to PatZilla, you should setup
a development sandbox, see :ref:`install-sandbox`.
